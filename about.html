  <p>I’m a Front End Web Developer with a passion for creating applications that are well-designed from the perspectives of both users and developers. Intuitive and responsive features enable users to easily navigate a website. Artistic, engaging designs – from whimsical to subtle, depending on the context – help draw users in.</p>

  <p>For developers, I write efficient, well-organized and clearly documented code. I want other developers to be able to jump into code I’ve written and quickly make sense of it so that it’s easy to maintain.</p>

  <p>I started out developing applications for MCI WorldCom and The Boeing Company before I took a break from the work force to raise three lively boys. The tech industry changed radically in that time and I’ve spent the last couple of years learning web development through coursework and open source projects. As technologies continue to evolve I look forward to expanding my skills and developing cutting-edge web applications. </p>
