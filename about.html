  <p>I’m a Front End Web Developer with a passion for creating applications that are well-designed from the perspective of both users and developers. Intuitive, reliable and responsive features enable users to easily navigate a website. Artistic, engaging designs – from whimsical to subtle, depending on the context – help draw users in.</p>

  <p>For developers, I write efficient, well-organized and clearly documented code. I want other developers to be able to jump into code I’ve written and quickly make sense of it so that it’s easy to maintain.</p>

  <p>I started out developing applications for MCI WorldCom and The Boeing Company before I took a break from the work force to raise three lively boys. The tech industry changed a ton in that time and I’ve spent the last couple of years learning web development through coursework and open source projects. As technologies continue to evolve I look forward to expanding my skills and developing cutting-edge web applications. </p>

  <p>I’m currently seeking a full-time position in front end web development and inquiries are welcome at dianezev@gmail.com.</p>
